## Unreleased

### Added
- **Source-code analysis (`mcpradar scan-source <path>`)**: static AST analysis
  of MCP server Python source, no server execution required. New `S` rule
  namespace:
  - S001 cloud-metadata SSRF (169.254.169.254 / metadata.google.internal)
  - S002 outbound request to an attacker-controllable host (host-pinned URLs
    are not flagged)
  - S003 unsafe deserialization (pickle / `yaml.load` without SafeLoader /
    marshal)
  - S004 dynamic code execution (`eval`/`exec` on a non-literal)
  - S005 SQL injection (`execute()` built with an f-string / concat / %-format)
  - S006 shell execution (`subprocess(..., shell=True)` / `os.system` / `os.popen`)
  - S007 **Description-Code Inconsistency** — a tool that presents as read-only
    (get/list/read/search…) whose handler writes to disk or executes commands.
    Network I/O is deliberately not a DCI signal (a read tool fetching from an
    API is normal), keeping the false-positive rate low.
  New module `src/mcpradar/source/`, 18 tests. Verified against the Appsecco
  corpus (wikipedia server: 0 false positives after the host-pinning and
  network-DCI guards).
- **Container sandbox (`--sandbox`)**: Untrusted stdio servers now run in a
  disposable Docker/Podman container during a scan — egress locked
  (`--network none` by default), ephemeral filesystem (`--rm` + tmpfs), all
  capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, and bounded pids/memory/cpu. The
  working directory is mounted read-only at `/workspace`. New
  `--sandbox-image` and `--sandbox-network` flags; the base image is
  auto-picked (python:3.12-slim / node:22-slim) from the launch command.
  New module `src/mcpradar/sandbox/`, 21 tests.

### Fixed
- **R109 (schema poisoning) false positives** surfaced by scanning real
  servers (yatuk/itu-mcp, 55 tools):
  - No longer scans **output** schemas — `additionalProperties: true` there is
    not an injection surface and structured-output frameworks (FastMCP) emit it
    for every dict-returning tool. This fired a HIGH on all 55 itu-mcp tools.
  - "No required fields" downgraded from MEDIUM to LOW — a tool accepting
    optional input is common and benign, not schema poisoning.
  - "Missing type" now recognizes `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`/`$ref`/`enum`/`const`
    as valid typing; Pydantic/FastMCP emit `anyOf: [{type: X}, {type: null}]`
    for every `Optional[...]` param, which was wrongly flagged 32× on itu-mcp.
- **Leaderboard deduplication**: the catalog carried 39 servers under two
  filename conventions, rendering as duplicate rows. The generator now
  deduplicates by server name, keeping the scanned copy over a pending stub
  (145 result files → 103 unique servers).
- **Leaderboard honesty**: 139 of 144 catalog entries had never actually been
  scanned yet were shown as clean grade-A passes. The generator now marks any
  result without scan evidence (no tools, scan id, or timestamp) as `pending`
  with no grade; the site renders these as "not scanned", sorts them to the
  bottom, excludes them from averages, and adds a scanned/pending filter.
- **Leaderboard grading** now scores on MEDIUM+ findings only (matching the
  accuracy benchmark). LOW informational lint (e.g. R114) is surfaced as a
  separate count but no longer drags clean reference servers toward a failing
  grade — the official filesystem server went from a bogus grade F (45 findings)
  to a defensible grade B (5 schema-laxity findings).
- **R107 (command injection)** no longer scans property `description` fields for
  shell metacharacters — those are prose/Markdown docs where backticks and
  operators appear legitimately, which produced CRITICAL false positives on
  well-documented servers (e.g. 4 on @playwright/mcp). It now scans only value
  fields (`default`, `example`); payloads hidden in prose remain R102/R104's job.
- **R107 (command injection)** had 0% recall on real servers: the
  dangerous-default check compared a lowercased value against a mixed-case set
  and used exact matching, so entries like `DROP TABLE` were unreachable and
  variants like `rm -rf /tmp/cache` never matched. Replaced with a
  case-insensitive prefix regex.
- **R106 (secret exposure)** flagged URL path segments as CRITICAL secrets —
  the "base64-like" pattern claimed an entropy check it never applied. Now
  gated on Shannon entropy > 4.5 and reported at HIGH.
- **R113 (path traversal)** over-reported: schema-constraint-absence findings
  demoted to LOW (MEDIUM for write-capable tools), and traversal-language
  matches inside protective documentation ("prevents path traversal") are no
  longer flagged.

### Changed
- **Benchmark**: `validation/` now scans an 11-target corpus (demo server + 3
  official reference servers as negative controls + 7 Appsecco lab servers)
  instead of a single self-made target. Metrics computed on MEDIUM+ findings;
  statically-undetectable classes labeled as known limitations. Measured:
  precision 87.5%, recall 100%, F1 0.93.

  F1 on labeled demo corpus. Benchmark runner at `validation/run_benchmark.py`.
